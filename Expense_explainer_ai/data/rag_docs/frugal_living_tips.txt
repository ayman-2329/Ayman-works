Frugal living is about being intentional with money. Buy only what you need and avoid impulse purchases.
Cook at home, buy in bulk, and reuse or recycle whenever possible. Compare prices before big purchases.
Buy second-hand when possible. Value quality over quantity. Small savings add up over time.
