Plan your salary using the 50-30-20 rule. Allocate 50% for essentials, 30% for lifestyle, and 20% for savings and debt.
Create standing instructions for SIPs and recurring deposits. Avoid unnecessary upgrades like gadgets or vehicles on EMI.
Review your salary use monthly and optimize. Always invest in self-education and upskilling.
