Investing is a way to grow your money by putting it into assets that can increase in value.
Start by understanding your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs.
Avoid trying to time the market; instead, focus on long-term growth. Use SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) for regular investing.
Never invest money you might need in the short term. Learn before you invest â€” don't follow trends blindly.
