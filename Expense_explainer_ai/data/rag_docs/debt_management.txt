Managing debt wisely is key to financial stability. Always pay more than the minimum due on credit cards.
Use the snowball method (paying smallest debts first) or avalanche method (highest interest first) to reduce debt.
Avoid taking new loans unless absolutely necessary. Consider consolidating loans if it lowers interest rates.
Track all your debts and make timely payments to protect your credit score.
