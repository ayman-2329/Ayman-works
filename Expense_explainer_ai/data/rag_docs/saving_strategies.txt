Saving should be automated and consistent. Set up auto-debits into a savings account right after your salary is credited.
Use multiple saving buckets: emergency, short-term goals (e.g., vacation), and long-term goals (e.g., house down payment).
Increase your saving rate when your income grows. Avoid lifestyle inflation â€” save raises instead of spending more.
