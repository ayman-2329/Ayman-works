Budgeting is the cornerstone of good personal finance. Start by tracking all income and expenses for at least one month.
Categorize your spending into essentials (rent, food, utilities) and non-essentials (entertainment, eating out). Set a monthly limit for each category.
Use the 50/30/20 rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings or debt repayment.
Review your budget monthly and adjust as needed. Use apps or spreadsheets to help manage it.
