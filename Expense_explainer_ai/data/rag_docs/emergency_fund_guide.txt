An emergency fund is money set aside to cover unexpected expenses like medical emergencies, job loss, or urgent repairs.
Experts recommend saving 3 to 6 months' worth of essential expenses. Keep your emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account.
Start small — aim for ₹10,000, then gradually increase. This fund brings peace of mind and protects you from debt in emergencies.
