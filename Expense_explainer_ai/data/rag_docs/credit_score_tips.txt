A credit score is a number that shows how trustworthy you are with borrowed money. Pay your loans and credit cards on time.
Keep your credit utilization below 30% of your limit. Don’t close old accounts — credit history helps.
Check your credit report yearly for errors. Build credit early — even a secured card helps.
